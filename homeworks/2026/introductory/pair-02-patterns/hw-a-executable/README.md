# I2A Enum Command Engine

Course track: Introductory Rust (2026)
Homework pair: I2
Type: executable
Submission filename: `main.rs`

Goal:
Implement the executable behavior described in this assignment and produce deterministic stdout for all provided test cases.

Testing contract:

1. Tests are text input/output files in `tests/`.
2. Input files use `*.in.txt`.
3. Expected output files use matching `*.out.txt`.
4. Output comparison is lenient about trailing whitespace and final newline.

Notes:

1. Keep output deterministic.
2. Do not print extra debug output in final submission.
