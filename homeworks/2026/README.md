# Rust Homeworks 2026 (Draft Scaffold)

This folder contains draft homework scaffolding for:

1. Introductory Rust (2026)
2. Advanced Rust (2026)

Structure rules:

1. Homeworks are grouped in lecture-linked pairs (`pair-XX-*`).
2. Each pair contains:
   - one executable homework (`hw-a-executable`)
   - one library homework (`hw-b-library`)
3. Default submission files:
   - executable: `main.rs`
   - library: `solution.rs`
4. Each homework should keep at least 4 tests.

Use the local runner in `homeworks/2026/executor/` for quick checks before publishing to ReCodEx.
