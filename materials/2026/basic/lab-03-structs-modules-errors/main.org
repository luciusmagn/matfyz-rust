* Lab Goals

1. Organize code into modules.
2. Define domain structs with constructors and methods.
3. Implement explicit error enums.

* Exercises

1. Build `Record` struct and parser from `name:value` lines.
2. Split parser and domain logic into separate modules.
3. Add `Result`-based API and unit tests for malformed input.
