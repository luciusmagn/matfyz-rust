#+AUTHOR: Lukáš Hozda
#+DATE: Winter 2026/27

* Lab Goals

1. Practice move/borrow reasoning in short programs.
2. Design signatures using owned vs borrowed inputs.
3. Prepare for homework pair I1.

* Exercises

1. Fix move errors in a parser function.
2. Refactor helper functions to take `&str` instead of `String` where possible.
3. Implement `fn normalize_words(input: &str) -> Vec<String>` with zero unnecessary clones.
4. Add tests for empty input and repeated spaces.
